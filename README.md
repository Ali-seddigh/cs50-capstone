# Purpose of the project:
This is my final project for The Harvard CS50 Web course.
Creating an online Quiz project aims to increase competition and effort among the students. To be listed on the website, students must constantly read and review their lessons, complete teacher-assigned daily tests, and participate in self-assessments.

# Distinctiveness and Complexity:
Distinctiveness of this project Unlike other course projects focusing on Wiki projects, Commerce, Mail, and Network, this project focuses on an online QUIZ system. Furthermore, it offers more benefits to students than other projects, and This project helps students to measure their skills compared to their other friends and review their lessons, The complexity of this project is to display questions randomly for each user and Each question once displayed for users, and the users can see grade results after the quiz, These were the three challenges and complications that I faced during the construction of the project and implemented it.

## Website Features:

### quiz test Features:
-   All questions are multiple-choice questions.
-   Each question is displayed only once per user.
-   Questions are displayed randomly for every user.
-   If the user by mistake presses refresh or go back to the previous page, there will be a new question for the user and the question he/she was on will be marked as attempted.
-   A message will be displayed after every attempted question whether the answer is correct or incorrect.

### Leaderboard features:
-   Leaderboard is a short list according to the score obtained by the users.
-   If two users have the same score, the user who has signed up earlier will have a better ranking than the one who joined late.
-   Leaderboard is open to all.

### Admin features:
-   Only the admin can add questions.
-   Admin can add questions and modify them until they are not marked as Has been published?
-   Once a question has been published, it can neither be modified nor can be accessed. Admin can only see a list of questions.
-   Admin can search questions by question text or choice text.
-   Admin can filter questions based on whether the questions have been published or not.
